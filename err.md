Cross Posted in Fend Project 6 Hi everyone! I am so happy to hear about the 2 extra weeks. I am making progress on project 6 but have hit a weird glitch. My shelves update but when you click to change it the page goes blank. If you refresh it reflects that you moved the book but I don't understand why the blank? I am assuming it is a lifecycle issue but not really sure. If someone can look over my github I would appreciate it! https://github.com/asutton1999/myReads
